This twitter bot will be associated with DSC MAIT twitter account. Whenever some tags us and share their experience of any workshop/session they attended, the bot should take the necessay action depending upon the tweet sentiment

# Tech Stack 
Python 

# Required features
The tweet should be analysed first whether it is a positive or negative sentiment. Only positive sentiment tweets should be liked, retweeted and the perosn should be followed. For negative sentiements, the bot should message the person that why the experience was bad and any feedback they can provide.

# Deployment
After some reseach I found pythonanywhere best suited. Heroku has problem of sleeping dynos and GCP would be paid service.

Do give your valuable feedback in the slack channel regarding deployment and more features.
